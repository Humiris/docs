<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before
  proceeding.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Humiris on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install Humiris:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install humiris-ai
  ```

```bash yarn
yarn add humiris-ai
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: At this step you will need your Moai Apikey to continue.{" "}
  <a href="https://docs.humiris.ai/quickstart">How to get my Moai Apikey</a> ?
</Info>

**Step 2**: Use a mixtuning:

After creating your API key, you'll need to add your cloud provider API keys to our platform as indicated [here](https://docs.humiris.ai/quickstart).

Once you've done that, you'll be able to perform your mixtuning after completing the necessary action in the mixtuning sction on the platform.

```typescript Typescript exemple
import MoAi from "humiris-ai";

const apiKey = "your_moai_apikey";
const moai = new MoAi(apiKey);

const payload = {
  mixTuningId: "your_mix_tuning_id",
  prompt: "What is the weather today?",
  systemInstruction: "Please provide a concise answer.",
  mixInstruction: "Cost optimization.",
  temperature: 10,
  maxTokens: 100,
};

async function testUseMixtuning() {
  try {
    const response = await moai.useMixtuning(payload);
    console.log("Response:", response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", (error as Error)?.message ?? "Unknown error");
  }
}

testUseMixtuning();
```

#### The payload

```typescript
const payload = {
  mixTuningId: "your_mix_tuning_id",
  prompt: "What is the weather today?",
  systemInstruction: "Please provide a concise answer.",
  mixInstruction: "Cost optimization.",
  temperature: 10,
  maxTokens: 100,
};
```

- mixTuningId: you can find it on the platform, in your mixtuning list.

- prompt: add you prompt here.

- systemInstruction: add the system instruction here.

- mixInstruction: add your mix instruction here.

- temperature: must be an integer

- maxTokens: must be an integer

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)
  and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting
