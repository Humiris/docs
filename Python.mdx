# Initialize the MoAi with your API key
moai = BasicMoAi(api_key='your_api_key')

# Create a payload for the AI service
messages = [
    MessageType(role='system', content='You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about technology.'),
    MessageType(role='user', content='What is the diference between a microprocessor and a central processing unit?')
]

payload = BasicPayload(
    mix_tuning_id='exampleId',
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=150
)

# Call the AI service
response = moai.use_basic_mixtuning(payload)
print(response)
```

**Advanced Usage**

```python
from humiris_ai import AdvancedMoAi, MessageType, AdvancedPayload

# Initialize the MoAi with your API key
moai = AdvancedMoAi(api_key='your_api_key')

# Create a payload for the AI service
messages = [
    MessageType(role='system', content='You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about technology.'),
    MessageType(role='user', content='What is the diference between a microprocessor and a central processing unit?')
]

payload = AdvancedPayload(
    advanced_mix_tuning_id='exampleId',
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=150
)

# Call the AI service
response = moai.use_advanced_mixtuning(payload)
